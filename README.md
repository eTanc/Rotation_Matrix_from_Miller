# Rotation_Matrix_from_Miller
Python code to compute a rotation matrix from Miller index

The crystaline direction defined with h,k,l with will be made parallel to Z direction. For a simple axial load, it should be on ZZ.

X and Y directions are not constrained (needs to be checked).

The main purpose of this code is to be used with MFront and mainly MTest for monocrystal simulations.
